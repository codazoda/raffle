# Raffle

A simple raffle script in HTML and JavaScript. Enter a list of names, one per line, and then click the pick button to pick a random name from the list.

This was written in one of my early live coding episodes [Coding a Raffle Winner Picker in JavaScript - S1 E4](https://youtu.be/-P7q_jkdYEA).
